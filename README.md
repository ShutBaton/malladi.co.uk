Welcome to my personal site, hosted at TBD!

This is the site I work on for fun, and I often integrate my other projects into it.

### Warp F1® in Schools Team

I am a member of the Warp F1® in Schools Team and so part of the project is hosted here - particularly the **_Unity WebGL_ release of WarpGame**, superceded by an **_Unreal Engine 5_ application called WarpRacer**.

Sadly the UE5 build is too heavy to run on the web and is a pain to put on GitHub (I would also need to build versions for a range of platforms, etc.)

| Engine        | Version Used      |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Unity         | `2021.3.29f1 LTS` |
| Unreal Engine | `5.3.2`           |
